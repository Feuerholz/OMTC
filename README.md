# OMTC
Generates a reddit-formated table with map info from an osu! MP link. Currently only works for the specific format of Corsace Open. The table is output into a txt file in the same directory as the executable.

IMPORTANT: This program is unable to distinguish FM from NM as the API does not return the necessary information to determine that.
