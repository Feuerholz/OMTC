# OMTC (osu! Match Thread Creator)
Generates text to be used as a base for osu! tournament match threads on reddit. Uses [OMP](https://github.com/Feuerholz/OMP) for API Access.

Currently supports only the specific format of Corsace Open 2018. Feel free to contact me/PR for any others. The following parts need to be added/replaced manually (or deleted if not desired):

-Corsace website match link

-Chat log link

-Bans

-FreeMod picks (shown as NM due to API limitations)

-Picks that weren't played

-Pick Order
